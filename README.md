# Cave Story Multiworld Connector Thing
This is a DLL mod that does 3 things:
1. Implements a parallel TSC event loop, allowing a second event to be ran
simultaneously alongside the game's "main" TSC processor;
2. Runs a TCP server allowing other programs to send events to that secondary
TSC parser (among other things);
3. Spawns a debug console allowing one to interact with both of those things
(debug builds only).

## Build Instructions
You will need a C++ compiler that supports the C++20 language standard to build
this project.

### Dependencies
This project requires the [Asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/) library (not included
with this repo). You may need to edit the project settings/Makefile to add the
header files for this library to your compiler's `#include` search directories.

### Microsoft Visual Studio (recommended)
Project files for Visual Studio 2019 are included in the repo.

### MSYS2 (MinGW 32-bit)
You must use the MinGW 32-bit environment of MSYS2 to build this project.
(The 64-bit environment gives linker errors when building, for some reason.)
You will also need to install GCC and make if they are not already installed.
You can install both of them at once by typing `pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc make`
in your terminal.

Once those are installed, simply type `make` from the top-level directory and it
should produce a `dinput.dll` output file in the `bin` folder.
You can also type `make debug` to compile with debug symbols enabled, or
`make clean` to delete all files generated by the compiler.
